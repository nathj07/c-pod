PREREQUISITES

to install all gem dependencies, simply run 'bundle' in this directory


BUILDING

to build this gem, simply call
rake build
this should build the .gem file in the pkg directory

or call 

rake install 

to install the gem in your local gem repository (for testing)

before committing an updated version of the gem to the repo, you'll probably want to 
increment the version number. This can be done in lib/deploynotify/version.rb

Finally, to install in the repo, call 

rake install_repo
to put the gem in the right place in this repo repository and update the gem index.
