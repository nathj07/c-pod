This Ruby library implements an interface to Extended Attributes. Support for this
varies from OS to OS and Filesystem to Filesystem. This package has been coded and
tested for Mac OS X (versions 10.4+) and Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.4+. It will probably
not build on other platforms.

This library inherits the limitations of the underlying filesystem EA support. 
These limitations are on name length, name syntax and value length. There may 
also be limitations on the total length of EA's. Providing you observe 'reasonable'
limits you should be OK. Reasonable limits are:

* Name lengths < 127 chars,
* Name syntax: Always begin with 'user.'
* Value length: < 2kB
* Total length: < 4kB

Check your FS documentation for specific details. This has been tested with:

[XFS] Limits: Name 255, Individual 64k, Total ~250k. Requires 'user.' prefix.

[EXT3] Limits: Name 255, Individual 4k, Total 4k. Requires 'user.' prefix.

[HFS+] Limits: Name 127, Individual ~3k. Total ~11k. 'user.' prefix not required.

[S3FS] Limits: Name ~127, Individual 2k, Total 2k.  'user.' prefix not required.

[HGFS] VMwares filesystem does NOT support EAs

*Note* In the above ~ denotes the largest value which tested successfully. The actual limit may be higher.
