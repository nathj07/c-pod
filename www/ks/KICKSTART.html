<h1>Using Kickstart</h1>

You can use kickstart to build a VM very quickly. If you have PXE boot then .... (tbc)
Otherwise download the network boot image xxxx and attach it as a CDrom ISO image to your VM. Boot up for a network install of Centos and when see the 'boot:' prompt, type the following:

<pre>
 linux ks=http://<!--#echo var="SERVER_NAME" -->/ks/&lt;file&gt;.ks
</pre>

This will remote boot and install a bare system, with git and the repositories configured.

The files are kickstart configurations for various types of machines.

<h2>Locations</h2>
<ul>
<li> All of the <a href="/ks">kickstart definitions</a> have been moved into their own directory on this server: <b>ks</b>
<li>In order to make it easier to create kickstart configurations I implemented server-side includes for files with an extension of 'ks'. Kickstart definitions can now include standard components using the syntax:
<pre>
&lt;!--#include virtual="include/opts_std.ks" --&gt;
</pre>
<li>This is recursive!
<li>Browse the <a href="/ks/include">include files</a>
<li>The directory <tt>nixvm</tt> contains custom configurations for Nick!
</ul>
