Repository for iParadigms Systems Engineering Group
===================================================

This GIT repository contains all the required packages for our software:
* YUM repositories
* GEM repositories
* Random downloads

It also serves as a Pixieboot and Kickstart server - but this hasn't yet been implemented here at iParadigms

Most of the configuration is done with the Apache configuration file repo.conf which is symlinked into
the /etc/httpd/conf.d/ directory as the file _repo.conf. All the layout assumes that this repo is cloned at the
location /data/repo

Notes
-----

1. Document root is /data/repo/www
This provides more control over what is accessible - executable scripts are now not 

2. ISO images are in their own subdirectory.
Both the image file itself (/data/repo/isoimages) and the mounted version (/mnt/osimages)
This means /etc/fstab has changed. We now have a single Apache directory conf for /mnt/osimages.

3. Only ONE point release of each Major Release of an OS is supported
So we have just Centos 5 which points through 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9 etc. and Centos 6 (6.2)

Naming Conventions for YUM repos
--------------------------------
	
The names of the YUM repositories are standardized so that we can use the $releasever variable.
This enables us to have a single /etc/yum.repos.conf/sye.repo file that automatically
points to the correct place.

The repo names are of the form:

	OSNAME/$releasever/TYPE

Where:
* OSNAME is one of:
** 'rhel', 'centos', 'fedora' etc.  (We only use centos right now)
** 'sye' is used for our custom packages
* $releasever is supplied by the OS - 6Server, 5Server (for RedHat), 5, 6 (for Centos) etc.
* TYPE is:
** 'repo' for the original packages, 'updates' for updates, 'dvd' for the whole DVD
** For the 'sye' packages we have 'stable' and 'unstable', corresponding to the environment.
