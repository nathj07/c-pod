This directory stores the *data* required to run the C-Pod.

If you want a complete backup of the C-Pod machine then backup this directory.

It is the home directory for the user that manages the Repository server. This
is a shared account accessed via .ssh/authorized keys.

The subdirectory 'c-pod' is a Git repository containing the 'source', this does
not contain any 'binary' artifacts, but it does contain everything that would
be needed to create those artifacts. If needed the artifacts are created in this
directory or subdirectories. The git repository is accessed by the same SSH key
which should be made available to git using agent-forwarding on the SSH
connection. Note that GitHub will track the actual user that commits to the
repository based on the key although the commit messages will reflect the
.gitconfig definition.

If you are prepared to download ISO's and rebuild packages (downloading their original
sources) then you can just clone 'repo'

PERMISSIONS
Group membership is used to enable sharing:
* The directories are setgid (so that the group ownership is inherited)
* The binaries set umask 002 (so group rw is enabled)
* Other users, such as 'apache' are made members of the 'c-pod' group
